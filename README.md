1) I am a mid-40 age woman and lives in Hawaii. Recently, I saw the mole on my right-upper arm. The color has been changed from yellow - brown - and now dark brown. I am little worried if this could be a skin cancer. I am a full time worker and I also have children that I do not have time to visit hospital. Therefore, I downloaded the “Skin Cancer App”. I used it to detect if my moles are symptoms of skin cancer. 

2) I am college student in Florida. I used to live in Boston before came to college. These days, the sun is too bright and my skin gets easily irritated. I wonder if my skin is not healthy enough as before. To make sure, I used the app to to check my level of skin health.
